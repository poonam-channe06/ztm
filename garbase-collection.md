# garbage-collection

1. javscript is a garbase collector language.
2. let say within a function we created an object and that object gets stored somehwere in our memory heap automatically with javascript.
3. When we finish calling the function and lets say we dont need thta object anymore itss going to clean up for us.
4. so javascript automaticlaly fress up this memory that we no longer use and well collect our garbage.
5. so only the data that is still useful to us remians s that this way we make sure we dont use up all the memory we have available because as we know, memmory is limited.
6. The garbae collector frees memory on the heap and prevents what we call memory leaks.
7. that is when memmory gets too big, until we reach our max size.Kind of like we did with the stackOverflow (recusrion type, function calling ame function again and again util it reaches to its max size).


## How does garbase collection actually works in JS ? 

1. take a ss of the image of video -19 garbage collection and then make it into MD file.
