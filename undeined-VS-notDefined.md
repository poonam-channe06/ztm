A variable is 'declared', it has its own placeholder but not having the value of itself 'defined' Hence 'undefined' and until the variable has assigned a value, the 'undefined' fills that particular placeholder and 'undefined' itself a datatype.


2. Not defined 

This case come in the error, where jS engine neither find that particular variable nor its placeholder and cannot find the variable in 1st phase of context(memory allocation context).
